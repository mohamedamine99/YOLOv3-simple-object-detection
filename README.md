# YOLOv3-simple-object-detection
This GitHub repository contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase simple object detection using YOLOv3 and Tiny YOLOv3 models. 
The notebooks demonstrate how to apply these models to both images and video files, and provide step-by-step instructions for implementing the object detection algorithm. 
Whether you're new to deep learning or just want to learn more about YOLOv3, this repository provides a great starting point for experimenting with object detection.
